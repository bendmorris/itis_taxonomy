**This repository is now deprecated; while the script will probably still work, 
development has moved to https://github.com/bendmorris/taxiphy**

This script will download the ITIS taxonomy and generate a Newick tree from the results.
Since the tree is large, this can require a large amount of memory.

Usage:

    python itis_taxonomy.py
